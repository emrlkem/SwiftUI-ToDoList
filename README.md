My first try to complete a full mobile application. While I did the ToDoList app, I used and applied some critical coding principles such as;

- using MVVM Architecture (Model, View, Model View)

- saving data with userDefaults

- applying animations

- adapting SwiftUI for iPad, landscape, and dark mode

- adding app icon and launch screen.
